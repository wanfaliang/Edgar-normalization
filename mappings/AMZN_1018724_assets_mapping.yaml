  # ========== CURRENT ASSETS ==========

  "Cash and cash equivalents":
    target: cash_and_cash_equivalents
    confidence: 1.0
    notes: "Direct match - no ambiguity"

  "Marketable securities":
    target: short_term_investments
    confidence: 1.0
    notes: "Marketable securities (current) are short-term investments"

  "Inventories":
    target: inventory
    confidence: 1.0
    notes: "Direct match (singular vs plural is semantic)"

  "Accounts receivable, net and other":
    target: net_receivables
    confidence: 0.9
    notes: "Contains both receivables and 'other' - primarily receivables. The 'and other' portion likely includes prepaids and other current assets but is not broken out separately."
    alternative_targets:
      - accounts_receivables
      - other_receivables

  "Total current assets":
    target: total_current_assets
    confidence: 1.0
    notes: "Direct match - control/total item"

  # ========== NON-CURRENT ASSETS ==========

  "Property and equipment, net":
    target: property_plant_equipment_net
    confidence: 1.0
    notes: "PP&E net of depreciation. Amazon's tag confirms this includes finance lease ROU assets."

  "Operating leases":
    target: other_non_current_assets
    confidence: 0.8
    notes: "Operating lease right-of-use asset (ASC 842). Not PP&E owned by Amazon, but a lease asset. Best fits 'other_non_current_assets' since it's not goodwill, intangibles, or investments."

  "Goodwill":
    target: goodwill
    confidence: 1.0
    notes: "Direct match"

  "Other assets":
    target: other_non_current_assets
    confidence: 0.9
    notes: "Catch-all for non-current assets not classified elsewhere. Likely contains: intangible assets (net), long-term investments, deferred tax assets, etc."
    likely_contains:
      - intangible_assets
      - long_term_investments
      - tax_assets

  "Total assets":
    target: total_assets
    confidence: 1.0
    notes: "Direct match - top-level control total"

# ========== UNMAPPED SCHEMA ITEMS ==========
# Items in your schema that Amazon doesn't report separately

unmapped_schema_items:
  cash_and_short_term_investments:
    status: "not_reported_separately"
    calculation: "cash_and_cash_equivalents + short_term_investments"
    note: "Can be derived by summing the two separate items"

  accounts_receivables:
    status: "included_in_other_item"
    source: "Accounts receivable, net and other"
    note: "Amazon doesn't break out trade receivables separately from other receivables"

  other_receivables:
    status: "included_in_other_item"
    source: "Accounts receivable, net and other"
    note: "Included in the same line as accounts receivable"

  prepaids:
    status: "included_in_other_item"
    source: "Accounts receivable, net and other"
    note: "Likely included in the 'and other' portion"

  other_current_assets:
    status: "included_in_other_item"
    source: "Accounts receivable, net and other"
    note: "The 'and other' portion covers various other current assets"

  intangible_assets:
    status: "included_in_other_item"
    source: "Other assets"
    note: "Amazon doesn't separately report intangibles (likely immaterial or included in Other assets)"

  goodwill_and_intangible_assets:
    status: "partial"
    calculation: "goodwill + (intangible_assets from Other assets)"
    note: "Goodwill is separate, intangibles are not broken out"

  long_term_investments:
    status: "included_in_other_item"
    source: "Other assets"
    note: "Non-marketable equity investments likely in Other assets"

    source: "Other assets"
    note: "Deferred tax assets likely in Other assets"

# ========== MAPPING SUMMARY ==========
summary:
  total_plabels: 10
  directly_mapped: 7
  mapped_with_notes: 3
  coverage: "10/20 schema items (50%)"
  notes: |
    Amazon uses a simplified balance sheet structure with fewer line items.
    Many granular items from the standardized schema are aggregated into:
    - "Accounts receivable, net and other" (contains receivables, prepaids, other current)
    - "Other assets" (contains intangibles, LT investments, tax assets, etc.)

    This is common for large tech companies - they prioritize simplicity over detail.
    The mapping is reliable for the items that are reported.
